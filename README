Lain is an sBNC bot, that handles things like channel statistics, channel logging, and custom channel messages on EsperNet.

Like most sBNC bots, it is coded in TCL, and runs as a sBNC user, on a instance of shroud BNC.

The scripts you find here, are coded to run on the sBNC user account 'lains' although this is easily changed.

FAQ:
Q:
I'm getting the following error, how do i fix it?: Invalid command name "khfloodc"
A:
The khflood scripts are in the bottom of the urltitle.tcl, this will need to be loaded prior to the scripts that use it.
This script helps to reduce the chance of people flooding the bot out by spamming commands.
