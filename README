Lain is an sBNC bot, that handles things like channel statistics, channel logging, and custom channel messages on EsperNet.

Like most sBNC bots, it is coded in TCL, and runs as a sBNC user, on a instance of shroud BNC.

The scripts you find here, are coded to run on the sBNC user account 'lains' although this is easily changed.
